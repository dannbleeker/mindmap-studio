// FROZEN MODULE-LEVEL t() — a real trap, armed for the day a locale picker ships.
//
// `t()` reads the ACTIVE locale at call time. A call inside a render function therefore follows a later
// `setLocale`; a call at module scope runs ONCE, when the module is first imported, and the string it
// returned is frozen into a `const` forever.
//
// CORRECTED 2026-07-27. This comment used to say the frozen strings "happen to be right, because the
// registry resolves the stored locale before any catalogue-consuming module loads". That was FALSE.
// `main.tsx` called `initLocale()` in its body, below `import { App }` — and ES imports are hoisted, so
// the whole eager graph had already evaluated its module-scope `t()` calls against DEFAULT_LOCALE.
// 99 of the 194 froze before resolution ever ran. Fixed by moving the call into the `src/i18n` barrel
// body (see test/i18n-init-order.test.ts); the remaining freeze-at-import behaviour is what this file
// documents.
//
// The trigger is also not what was written here. It is not a language picker — it is `LOCALES`
// (registry.ts) gaining a second entry. `resolveLocale()` consults `navigator.languages`, so the day a
// second catalogue ships, a Danish browser gets a half-English first paint with no user action at all:
// panel tabs, slash commands, edge presets and the Start sidebar in English inside an otherwise Danish
// app. Nothing outside tests calls `setLocale`, which is why this is still latent rather than live.
//
// This file PINS the mechanism in both directions so the trap cannot be rediscovered by a user. It is
// deliberately not a fix: converting 194 constants to getters is a behaviour-neutral refactor with real
// call-site churn, and it is listed in docs/I18N_BLOCKED.md for the owner.
