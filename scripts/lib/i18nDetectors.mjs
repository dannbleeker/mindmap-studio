// import from here. They were briefly two copies of the same regexes; a copy silently lost a `\\s` and
// reported zero `label=` hits on a file that had sixty, which is precisely the kind of quiet wrong
// answer this guard exists to prevent. One source of truth for a cross-cutting rule.

// to widen the exceptions. If a genuinely non-user-facing string trips it, narrow the check.
