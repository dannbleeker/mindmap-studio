// The pseudo-locale harness — the only check that can prove an i18n migration batch CORRECT.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Migrating a string is observationally a no-op: English before, English after. So
// `pnpm gate`, a clean diff review and a dev-server screenshot are all *guaranteed* to pass on a batch
// that silently dropped a string on the floor, wired a call site to the wrong key, or left a label
// hardcoded. Every one of those has happened in this migration. The gate cannot see them because there
// is nothing to see — until you make the catalogue say something different from the source.
//
// That is what this does. `registerMessages` merges and LATER REGISTRATIONS WIN (see i18n/registry.ts),
// so overlaying the live catalogue with a marked-up copy is enough — no second locale, no build change,
// no production code touched.
//
//   MARKER mode  — every message becomes ⟦…⟧. Any user-visible text WITHOUT the marker is a string the
//                  app did not get from the catalogue: unmigrated, or hardcoded, or lost.
//   ECHO mode    — every message becomes its own KEY. This is the only way to tell a correct reuse from
//                  a plausible wrong one: it renders `toolbar.layout`, so the assertion names the exact
//                  key the call site read, not merely that it read something.
//
// The overlay is GLOBAL MUTABLE STATE. Always pair it with `restoreCatalogues()` in an afterEach, or
// the next test file to touch i18n inherits a marked-up catalogue and fails somewhere unrelated.
