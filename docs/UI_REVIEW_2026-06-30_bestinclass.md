# Fresh UI review — best-in-class features (2026-06-30)

A second, features-focused review with fresh eyes — run *after* the UI-1…UI-7 remediation + tails
shipped. Where the [June research report](UI_RESEARCH_2026-06-30.md) targeted *polish* (chrome, a11y,
density), this one asks a different question: **what best-in-class capabilities would elevate the
product**, filtered hard against the as-built feature set and the decided-against list.

This doc was revised after a **23-agent verified gap scan**: a code-grounded as-built inventory → 10
gap lenses → a **skeptic pass that refuted every claimed gap against the actual repo** (dropping anything
already shipped) → dedupe/group → a completeness audit. The skeptic pass corrected this review's own first
draft (see the correction note below), so every "already shipped" and every gap here is code-checked.

> **Correction to the first draft of this doc.** The verified scan proved two items the first draft
> pitched as "Tier-1 missing" already ship: **interactive offline HTML export** (`io/interactiveHtml.ts` —
> a single self-contained file with collapsible branches, search/filter, and pan/zoom) and **in-map fuzzy
> jump-to-topic** (`editorCommands.ts` `jump:*` rows in ⌘K). Their real, narrower gaps survive below
> (visual fidelity in the HTML export; a *cross-map* quick switcher). Honesty over a clean headline.

## The honest headline

**This is not a "what's missing" exercise — it's a "what's left" one.** The inventory turned up ~180
shipped capabilities; the app already has the large majority of every competitor's feature set *and*
several genuinely **best-in-class strengths** most rivals can't match:

- **Local-first + fully offline, no account, no telemetry** — rare in this category; the core identity.
- **MindManager `.mmap` round-trip completeness** (rich text, icons→emoji, tasks, relationships,
  boundaries, callouts, per-topic styling all survive) — better interop than most. 14 import + 17 export
  formats, incl. a **self-contained interactive HTML** and a **standalone HTML slide deck**.
- **Conditional styling / SmartRules** (render-time auto-formatting by tag/marker/priority/completion).
- **Canvas == export fidelity** (SVG/PNG/PDF/PPTX render identically to screen, documented + tested).
- **WCAG 2.2/2.5 maturity** with assertions in CI (incl. the `role="tree"` outline + SR relationships
  list from this month's work).
- **Presenter view** (notes + clickable agenda + next-slide), **version-history playback**, **12 layouts**
  + free canvas, **Power Filter** + saved presets, a genuinely-working **responsive/touch** build.

So the add-list is a **finite, code-verified set of gaps**, not an open-ended wishlist. Below: first the
shipped baseline (so nothing here is re-pitched), then **all 93 verified gaps grouped into 11 themes**,
then the recommended slice.

---

## Already shipped — NOT re-pitched (verified in code)

A best-in-class review usually proposes these; this app already has them, so they're excluded from the
gap list below: focus-mode/drill-into-subtree (`useFocusHotkey`, `drillId`), **saved views/perspectives**
(`savedViews.ts`), **detail-level folding** ("Show detail level 1–5" in ⌘K), summaries + boundaries +
callouts, outline numbering, breadcrumb + minimap, **per-node backlinks / "Linked-from"**, marker/tag
index, **Power Filter** + saved filters + extract-matches-to-map, cross-map + in-map **fuzzy search** with
Find Next/Prev, **find-and-replace** (`replaceTopics`, regex), an **editable Outline panel** (rename,
drag-reorder, ◂▸ indent, Tab/Enter), **image-paste** + **paste-text→map** + **paste-table→subtree**,
conditional styling, Kanban, agenda/stats panels, **12 layouts** + free canvas with **align/distribute**
+ **auto branch-colour** + **format painter**, **multi-select bulk** icon/tag ops, **tag rename/merge**,
**14 node shapes**, roll-ups across maps, version-history playback, the **brainstorm timer**, the
contextual action bar + accessible tree, a `⌘K` palette with **in-map fuzzy jump-to-topic**, and a
**self-contained interactive HTML export** (collapsible + searchable + pan/zoom, offline) alongside the
static-image HTML, PPTX, PDF (+notes), DOCX, XLSX, and 8 mind-map formats.

---

## All gaps, grouped (93, code-verified)

> **Shipped since this review** (struck through below; see CHANGELOG):
> **Wave 1** — free colour pickers (G5 Text/Fill/Branch), paste-URL→titled node (G1), copy-map-as-image
> (G11), presenter pacing timer + pacing colour + B/W blackout (G7), cross-map quick switcher (G2),
> reveal-in-outline auto-scroll (G2).
> **Wave 2 ("serious maps")** — sort children (G4), multi-branch clipboard (G4), "Links to" outgoing
> inspector (G3), map-wide relationships panel (G3), promote-branch-to-map (G4), merge-map-as-branch (G4).
> **Flagships** — big-map virtualisation (G6), visual-map slides + cinematic zoom (G7, as a 🎬 mode on the
> guided walk).
> **Data-safety pack (G9/G11)** — trash/undo-delete, cross-tab clobber guard, external-file conflict
> detection, Open Recent.
> **Search & nav pack (G2 — now complete)** — search beyond topic+note, scoped/operator search,
> deep-link to a node, back/forward navigation history, across-maps result context (breadcrumb +
> snippet), and the in-map Find "List all" results list.
> **Quick-wins pack** — filter by completion status (G8), `Ctrl/⌘+,` opens Settings (G9), reduced-motion
> support + in-app toggle (G10).
> **Knowledge-linking / capture / a11y packs** — cross-map topic links + in-note in-app links (G3),
> multi-line burst quick-capture (G1), keyboard Outline reorder + SR overlay lists (G10). The remaining
> list is what's left to build.

Tags per gap: **scope** (`in` in-scope · `?` needs a product call · all out-of-scope items are listed
separately) · **impact** (high/med/low) · **effort** (S/M/L) · **status** (`missing` / `partial`).
"partial" = the model or a sibling surface already exists; the named sub-capability is the delta.

### 1 · Capture & low-friction input (12)
The single richest cluster; mostly offline UI over existing model fields.

### 3 · Knowledge structure & linking (13)
The deepest backlog; several items brush the decided-against "no graph" boundary.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Cross-map topic links~~ ✅ shipped | `#map=<id>&node=<id>` opens a map + focuses a topic; inspector topic-picker to author it | `done` |

| Undo history tree / branching undo | redo survives editing after an undo | `?·low·L·partial` |

### 5 · Styling, theming & visual encoding (10)
The three colour gaps are high-impact S-effort: the model fields already accept any CSS colour; only the picker UI is missing.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Free colour picker for node fill~~ ✅ shipped | hex/HSV → existing `NodeStyle.background` | `done` |
| ~~Node text colour control~~ ✅ shipped | `NodeStyle.color` renders but has no setter UI | `done` |

| One-click "colourful/rainbow node fills" | tint each branch's node fills by palette | `?·low·S·partial` |

### 6 · Layout, canvas & scale (7)
Mostly React Flow flag/viewport work; the cinematic-zoom item overlaps the presentation cluster.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Big-map virtualisation~~ ✅ shipped | `onlyRenderVisibleElements` — fluid 1000+ nodes | `done` |
| Auto-fit / keep-in-view after structural edits | pan/zoom so new/remaining content stays visible | `in·med·M·partial` |
| Partial / touch marquee + no-modifier lasso | select any node a marquee touches; plain left-drag | `in·med·S·partial` |

| Minimap match/selection highlighting | show search/filter hits + clearer viewport frame | `?·low·S·partial` |

### 7 · Presentation, sharing & export (18)
The largest lens. Presenter-control items are cheap S-effort wins; visual-slide items are the L-effort flagship.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Presenter pacing timer / elapsed clock~~ ✅ shipped | live elapsed/remaining in presenter view | `done` |
| ~~Slides rendered as the visual map~~ ✅ shipped | the guided-walk canvas IS the styled slide (🎬 mode) | `done` |

| Print/export options dialog | size/scale/margins/contents before producing | `?·low·M·missing` |
| Animated GIF / WebM map export | short animation of a walk/history (MediaRecorder) | `?·low·L·missing` |

### 8 · Task & metadata layer — light, in-scope (5)
Wire up fields the model already carries without crossing into the decided-against PM engine.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Filter by completion status~~ ✅ shipped | Power Filter Completion select over rolled-up progress | `done` |
| Natural-language / relative due-date entry | "today"/"next fri"/"+7d" → ISO (`addDaysISO` exists) | `in·med·M·missing` |
| Quick date set / reschedule chip on canvas | inline Today / +1wk like the progress pie (DateChip is display-only) | `?·med·M·missing` |
| Duration & resources editing UI | model carries + import fills them; user can't set them | `?·med·M·partial` |
| Resource / assignee index & filter | a filterable facet paralleling markers & tags | `?·low·M·partial` |

### 9 · Files, library & autosave durability (13)
The data-loss-risk items are the high-impact core of a local-first PWA.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Cross-tab / multi-window safety~~ ✅ shipped | BroadcastChannel presence guard warns on two-tab open | `done` |
| ~~Trash / undo-delete for maps~~ ✅ shipped | soft-delete (`meta.trashedAt`) + Start-screen Trash restore/empty | `done` |

| PWA app shortcuts / richer manifest | `shortcuts` + `screenshots` for install UI | `?·low·S·partial` |

### 10 · Accessibility & input modalities (13)
A11y is already strong; these are the genuine remaining deltas.
| Gap | What | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| Touch drag-and-drop fallback | outline/board/marker DnD use HTML5 drag → dead on touch | `in·high·M·partial` |
| ~~High-contrast theme + `prefers-contrast`/`forced-colors`~~ ✅ shipped | OS-aware high-contrast | `done` |

## Stays decided-against (no change recommended)

Sound existing decisions for a no-backend local-first app, listed so they're not mistaken for oversights:
real-time collaboration / multiplayer; a networked/cyclic multi-parent graph (TheBrain-style); the
project-management engine (Gantt, dependencies, resources, formulas, custom attributes — and its
fellow-travellers the scan flagged: **due-date reminders/notifications, recurring tasks,
repeat-last-edit**); AI assist; voice/audio capture; LaTeX/math; arbitrary custom fonts; true split-pane
multi-map editing; an infinite Miro-style object canvas; live web/data embeds; and any **hosted** share
link — the shipped offline interactive-HTML export is the local-first answer to that need.

---

## Recommended slice (if you build)

The verified picture skews to **partials** (the model already carries the fields) and to two heavy
clusters — presentation/export and knowledge-linking. Three coherent bundles:

- **Quick-wins sprint (high-impact · S-effort · all in-scope):** the three free colour pickers
  (fill / text / branch), the presenter **timer + B-to-black + pacing-colour** trio, **filter-by-completion**,
  **URL→title** on paste, and **copy-as-image** to the clipboard. Almost all are UI over fields/derivations
  that already exist — a high delight-per-effort first pass.
- **"Serious maps" pack:** **promote-/merge-branch-between-maps** + **map-wide relationships panel** +
  **scoped search** + **back/forward history** + **big-map virtualisation (L)**, with **cross-tab safety**
  and **trash/undo-delete** as the data-safety backbone. Targets the one place this otherwise-complete app
  still trails — working fluidly with large, structured, interconnected maps — plus the local-first
  durability a single-user PWA owes its data.
- **"Present like Prezi" pack:** make the existing deck render **slides as the visual map** and add the
  **cinematic zoom walkthrough** (both L) — the differentiated, demo-able swing once the cheap presenter
  controls land.

If you build only three things: **the colour pickers (S)**, **filter-by-completion (S)**, and
**promote-branch-to-map (M)** — two near-free high-impact wins plus the most-requested restructure verb.

## Method & sources

Inventory is code-grounded (this repo). The gap scan ran as a 23-agent fan-out (inventory → 10 lenses →
per-lens skeptic verification against the code → dedupe/group → completeness audit), so every "already
shipped" exclusion and every gap status (`missing`/`partial`) is checked against the source — the
skeptic pass is what caught this doc's own first-draft errors (interactive-HTML export and in-map
jump-to-topic, both already shipped). External best-in-class references: XMind (New Sheet from Topic,
Tree Table, ZEN, Pitch), MindNode (stickers, Quick Entry, Colorful), SimpleMind (smart roll-up, colour
wheel), Obsidian (search operators, backlinks/outgoing panes, aliases, quick-switcher, tags pane),
Roam/Logseq (typed links, transclusion, unlinked mentions), Heptabase (mirrors), TheBrain (link-centred
graph, nav history), Notion (slash menu, `@`-date, paste intelligence), Workflowy (quick-add tokens),
Prezi / XMind Pitch (cinematic present), reveal.js / Keynote / PowerPoint (presenter timer, pacing,
fragments, blackout), VS Code (go-to, back/forward, settings sync).
