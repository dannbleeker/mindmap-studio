// it from the file's leading comment block, and `biome check --write` sorts imports — if the long
// explanation below sat here instead, biome would attach it to the first import and carry the
// directive with it, silently dropping this file back to the `node` environment. It failed exactly
// that way once; the tests then die on `document is not defined` rather than passing quietly, but only
// because everything here renders.

  // descriptions are library strings, not ours, and no catalogue of ours can mark them. Narrowing the
  // root is the honest way to exclude them; adding them to `ignore` would be teaching the harness to
  // skip real English text by content, which is exactly how an ignore list starts lying.
