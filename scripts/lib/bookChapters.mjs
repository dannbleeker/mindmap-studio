 * Hand-listed (rather than an alphabetical directory sort) so re-ordering and
 * renaming is explicit and appendices never intermix with numbered chapters.
 * Mirrors `docs/guide/README.md`.
 *
 * Add a chapter: append the filename to CHAPTER_FILES AND give the new file an
 * H1. `readChapterMetadata` reads the H1 (title) + optional H3 (subtitle) from
 * the source, so a rename can't silently drift the table of contents.
