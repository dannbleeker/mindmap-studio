// The frozen-`t()` RATCHET. A per-file budget of module-scope `t()` calls that may only shrink.
//
// test/i18n-frozen-constants.test.ts proves WHY these are a trap: a `t()` at module scope is evaluated
// once, at import, so its string cannot follow a later `setLocale`. This file makes sure the count
// cannot quietly grow while the rest of the migration continues — the shape is easy to reach for
// (a module-level `const LAYOUTS = [{ label: t("…") }]` reads perfectly naturally) and there are 194
// existing examples to copy from, so "don't do that" is not a strategy that survives contact.
//
// The budget doubles as the worklist. Fixing a file means giving it getters or making it a function,
// then lowering its number here; the entry disappears when it reaches zero. Adding a file is not
// possible without editing this list, which is the point — it forces the decision to be deliberate.

// Re-measured 2026-07-27: 194 → 145. Cleared so far: stickers.ts (25), flow/slashCommands.ts (9),
// start/AppTips.tsx (8) and Recent.tsx (3). Recent's was a side effect of fixing a data-loss bug, not
// a freeze fix — it keyed date buckets on the rendered label, so a translated label stopped matching
// and whole sections of maps disappeared (test/start-library-sections.test.tsx).
//
// WHAT THIS NUMBER DOES NOT MEAN — still true, and the reason not to chase it to 0:
//   - The detector counts `t(` calls, so a module-scope DERIVATION that materialises its inputs is
//     invisible to it. Three such sites existed and are now FIXED — `MapPanel`'s `LAYOUT_NAME` and
//     `Kanban`'s `SOURCES` became functions, and `icons.ts`'s group names became getters — but the
//     class is not detectable, so the next one will be silent too. If you convert a table to getters,
//     check what reads it at module scope.
//   - Strings that are raw English LITERALS score 0 here and 0 in the scanner while rendering
//     untranslated. That was the layout names, marker-group names, sticker categories and priority
//     labels; all migrated 2026-07-27. `pnpm i18n:blindspot` is what finds the rest.
// A sweep that empties this table while the layout picker still reads "Radial / hub" in Danish is the
// "green tick that measured nothing" pattern this codebase keeps rediscovering.
