// Organic, tapered branch (the MindManager "trunk that fans" look): all of a parent's children spring
// from ONE point on the side they sit, leave straight out (so the fan never crosses), enter each child
// at its near end, overlap both boxes (always touch), and taper from a chunky trunk to a fine tip. The
// shared side is computed per parent in FlowMindMap.sync() and carried on `data.attachSide`; when it
// hasn't arrived yet (the first frame) we fall back to this edge's own parent→child direction. The
// geometry lives in flow/floating.ts so the SVG exporter reuses it byte-for-byte (canvas == export).

// Memoised: React Flow re-renders every edge when the edge array changes. The geometry tracks live
// node movement through `useInternalNode` (a store subscription memo never blocks), so memo only
// skips the redundant re-renders driven by unrelated parent state.
