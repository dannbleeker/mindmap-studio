// Test setup for component + hook tests (the @testing-library/react net for the panels/hooks).
// jsdom doesn't implement the layout/observer APIs the panels and hooks reach for, so polyfill the
// handful they need here. Wired via vitest.config.ts `setupFiles`; runs before every test file.
//
// This file runs for EVERY test (setupFiles is global), including the pure-logic + store tests that
// use the `node` environment. Those have no `window`/`document`, so everything here is guarded to be
// a no-op under node — it only takes effect for the jsdom-environment component/hook tests.

//
// In the app this is guaranteed: main.tsx imports the i18n barrel, which registers core, long before
// any lazy chunk loads. A unit test that imports a lazy LEAF directly — `test/bulk-node-menu.test.tsx`
// renders BulkNodeMenu on its own — has no such path. The leaf imports `./messages` and so gets the
// CANVAS catalogue, but any message it reads from the eager one (`common.markers`, `common.tags`)
// resolves to nothing and `t()` throws.
//
// Fixed here rather than per-test, so the next lazy leaf test does not rediscover it. NOT fixed by
// having flow/messages.ts pull in core — that would drag the whole eager chrome catalogue into the
// lazy canvas chunk and undo the bundle arrangement the whole layer is built around.
