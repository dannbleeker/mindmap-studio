// eager graph — including 99 module-scope `t()` calls that would already have frozen against the
// default locale. See the comment in src/i18n/index.ts.
//
// This call is kept as a belt-and-braces no-op for any entry point that reaches main.tsx without
// having imported the barrel. It re-resolves to the same value; `initLocale` is idempotent.

// StrictMode intentionally omitted: its double-invoked effects re-init the canvas
