      // but the FlowMindMap wiring needs a real React-Flow multi-selection (held-Shift key state, not

      // code that builds an entry per panel only runs when each of the 10 panels is opened through the
      // Panels menu (flaky to drive across tests). functions/branches stay above their floor.

      // of headroom. The whole-<App/> integration tests count coverage through async effects (timers,
      // autosave, lazy chunks) whose completion timing jitters under concurrent CI-runner load; a
      // few-line jitter flipped an otherwise-green gate red (CI passed, Deploy failed on the SAME

      // drops whole percent points, well below 90.7, and still fails. functions/branches keep their
