// was deleted from a catalogue fails `tsc --noEmit` (which the gate runs) instead of rendering blank.
//
// These are TYPE-ONLY imports. They erase completely at build time, so listing a lazy chunk's catalogue
// here does NOT pull that chunk into the entry bundle — which is the whole reason the catalogues can be
// chunk-local while the key type stays global. Keep them `import type`; a value import would undo it.
//
// As each catalogue is added (io, …) add its key type to this union.
